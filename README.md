This is a fun project I was inspired to do from seeing YouTube videos on Procedural Grass. Creators that inspired the project can be seen below:
- Acerola's Procedural Grass Series: "How Do Games Render So Much Grass?", "Modern Foliage Rendering", "What I Did To Optimize My Game's Grass"
- SimonDev's YouTube video, "How do Major Video Games Render Grass?"

Although the output of this project is not as developed compared to what can be seen in the referenced videos, I had learnt a lot about Unity and Shaders throughout the development process,
and I aim to learn more of this topic through future projects.
